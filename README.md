# ML2024

This repository contains my homework and learning progress for the **Introduction to ML** machine learning course at **NYCU**.

## Homework

### HW1 - Data Preprocessing
This includes homework on data preprocessing, covering basic data cleaning, feature scaling, and preparation techniques used in machine learning.

### HW2 - Multi-layer Perceptron
This includes homework on implementing a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) from scratch using only numpy and pandas.

More assignments and learning resources will be added as I continue through the course.
